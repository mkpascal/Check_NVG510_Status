Check_NVG510_Status
======

My internet connection at one of my place is terrible. It's DSL. The building is old.
The connection keeps disconnecting and I don't know when it will be up again... 

And, because I don't want to keep refreshing the bad user interface of the modem, I quickly made this.
This is quick and dirty. It only works with the NVG510 modem. So, it'll be probably useless for you.

Check_NVG510_Status, as the name implies, will let you check the status of the 
modem. It's a simple Sinatra app. It will just let me know the status
of the connection by parsing the modem page for me.

## Usage ##

You can then start the server with:

`ruby check_status.rb`

Then, just go to

`http://localhost:4567/`
